## Introduction
This repository showcases my hands-on experience with essential Linux commands and SQL queries, applied in a cybersecurity context. The activities included here were completed as part of the "Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL" course, which is part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. Each lab exercise focused on building practical skills in managing files, permissions, software installations, and querying databases using Linux and SQL.

## Portfolio Activities

### 1. Install Software in a Linux Distribution
**Summary**: This activity focused on installing and uninstalling applications in a Linux environment using the Advanced Package Tool (APT). I installed tools like Suricata and tcpdump, managed their installation and removal, and reinstalled applications to ensure system security and functionality.

### 2. Examine Input and Output in the Shell
**Summary**: I explored how to handle input and output in the Bash shell using commands like `echo` and `expr` for basic calculations. This exercise helped to strengthen the understanding of how commands are executed in a Linux terminal.

### 3. Find Files with Linux Commands
**Summary**: This activity involved navigating the Linux file system and locating files using commands like `pwd`, `ls`, and `cat`. It was essential for understanding how to navigate and manipulate files in a Linux environment, crucial for managing security-related tasks.

### 4. Filter with Grep
**Summary**: In this activity, I used the `grep` command to search through files and identify specific strings, such as error messages in server logs. This is a critical tool for searching and analyzing large sets of data, especially when investigating security incidents.

### 5. Manage Files with Linux Commands
**Summary**: This exercise focused on managing directories and files, including creating, moving, deleting, and modifying files. I also learned to use the `nano` text editor to add and edit file contents, an important skill for managing system configurations.

### 6. Manage File Permissions in Linux
**Summary**: This activity emphasized managing file permissions, which is essential for maintaining security on a system. I learned to modify file and directory permissions, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive files, using commands like `chmod` and `ls -l`.

### 7. Apply Filters to SQL Queries
**Summary**: I applied SQL filters using `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators to retrieve specific information from a database. The queries focused on retrieving login attempts, employees' data, and other details crucial for investigating security incidents.

## Conclusion
This collection of activities demonstrates my growing proficiency in using Linux commands and SQL queries, both essential tools for a cybersecurity professional. By applying these skills in real-world scenarios, I have strengthened my ability to manage systems, troubleshoot issues, and investigate security events.
