## Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python

This repository contains projects and code samples developed during the **"Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python"** course, which is part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. This course introduced the fundamentals of Python and its practical use in automating cybersecurity tasks.

### Key Learnings

Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience with Python programming and its applications in cybersecurity. Below is an overview of the key concepts I covered:

- **Python Programming in Cybersecurity:** Understanding how Python is used to automate common cybersecurity tasks such as log analysis, parsing files, and scanning for security vulnerabilities.
  
- **Conditional and Iterative Statements:** Writing effective conditional (`if-else`) and iterative (`for` and `while`) statements to control program flow and automate decision-making processes.

- **Custom Functions:** Creating user-defined functions to modularize and reuse code, improving efficiency and readability in Python programs.

- **String and List Manipulation:** Utilizing Python's built-in capabilities to handle string and list data structures for tasks such as searching, sorting, and filtering data in security logs.

- **Regular Expressions (Regex):** Extracting and processing specific data patterns from text files, such as IP addresses or login attempts, to streamline security analysis.

- **File Handling:** Using Python to read, write, and update files, essential for managing security logs and other important cybersecurity documents.

- **Code Readability and Debugging:** Applying best practices for writing clear, maintainable code and debugging to identify and resolve errors efficiently.
