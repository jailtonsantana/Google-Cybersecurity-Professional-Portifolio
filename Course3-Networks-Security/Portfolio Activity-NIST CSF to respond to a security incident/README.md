## **Activity: Incident Response Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework**

### **Overview**:
In this activity, I analyzed a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on a multimedia company's internal network. Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), I worked through each phase of the incident response process to improve the organization’s security posture. The goal was to document the security event, identify weaknesses, and propose solutions for better future incident handling.

### **Key Steps**:
1. **Identify**: The attack was identified as a DDoS using ICMP flood packets that targeted the network due to a misconfigured firewall.
2. **Protect**: Recommendations included implementing a firewall rule to limit ICMP packets, enabling source IP verification, and enforcing stronger network monitoring.
3. **Detect**: Focused on implementing continuous monitoring tools, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and analyzing network logs for abnormal activity.
4. **Respond**: A response plan was created to isolate compromised systems, neutralize the threat, and gather necessary data for post-incident analysis.
5. **Recover**: Developed a recovery strategy to restore critical services from backups, verify system integrity, and improve the disaster recovery process.

### **Takeaway**:
This activity demonstrates how the NIST CSF can be applied to enhance an organization’s ability to respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents. By following structured processes, security teams can mitigate risks and prevent future incidents.
