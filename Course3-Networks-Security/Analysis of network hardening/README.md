## Network Hardening Assessment: Social Media Organization Data Breach

### Overview
In this activity, I acted as a security analyst investigating a major data breach at a social media organization. The breach exposed customer personal information due to undetected vulnerabilities in the network. My task was to identify key vulnerabilities and propose effective network hardening tools and methods to protect the organization from future attacks.

### Key Vulnerabilities Identified:
1. Employees sharing passwords.
2. Admin password for the database set to default.
3. Lack of firewall rules to filter network traffic.
4. No use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

### Recommendations for Hardening:
1. **Password Policies**: Implement strict password policies, including hashing and salting techniques to prevent password guessing attacks.
2. **Firewall Maintenance**: Regularly update firewall rules to block unwanted traffic and prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for administrative access to prevent brute force and unauthorized login attempts.

### Outcome
By addressing these vulnerabilities with appropriate hardening practices, the organization can better secure its network and reduce the likelihood of future breaches. These measures provide stronger access controls, protect sensitive data, and ensure that the organization can identify and mitigate threats before they become major issues.
