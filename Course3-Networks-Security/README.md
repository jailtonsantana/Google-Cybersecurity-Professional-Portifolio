# Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security - Course Description

This course provided a comprehensive understanding of computer networks and their security. It covered foundational topics such as how networks operate, how data is transmitted, and various methods to secure networks against potential threats. Below is a summary of what I learned during this course:

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Network Types and Components**: I learned about the different types of networks, such as local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs), and how they connect multiple devices to enable communication. The course also covered key network components like routers, switches, and modems.
- **Data Transmission**: I gained an understanding of how data is sent and received over networks, focusing on network protocols like Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This included insights into how packets are transmitted, routed, and received by different network devices.
- **Network Security**: The course explored common network-level vulnerabilities and how to protect networks from cyber threats. I learned about the role of firewalls, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and intrusion detection systems (IDS) in securing networks.
- **System Hardening**: I explored various system hardening techniques that help reduce vulnerabilities, such as disabling unnecessary services, patch management, and configuring firewalls. These practices ensure that networks are less susceptible to attacks.

### Skills Gained:
- **Network Architecture Understanding**: I can now describe the structure of different networks and how their design impacts security.
- **Network Security Implementation**: I learned how to secure a network using firewalls, system hardening, and VPNs. This includes recognizing common network protocols and securing them against intrusion tactics.
- **Cloud Computing vs. Local Networks**: I gained insights into how cloud computing differs from local networks in terms of architecture and security, as well as how to harden systems against threats in both environments.

### Practical Applications:
Throughout the course, I practiced applying these concepts by simulating real-world cybersecurity tasks. This hands-on approach strengthened my understanding of how to secure networks from intrusions and manage ongoing threats. Additionally, I learned how to address the security challenges posed by modern cloud infrastructure.
