## Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response

### Overview

In this course, I focused on the core concepts and tools related to incident detection and response. The course explored various aspects of the incident response lifecycle, roles within incident response teams, and the technical methods used to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents.

### Key Learnings

#### Incident Response Lifecycle
I gained an in-depth understanding of the incident response lifecycle, including the steps from detection to recovery. These steps encompass preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Each phase plays a vital role in ensuring efficient incident management.

#### Tools and Technologies
The course introduced a range of tools essential for incident detection and management:
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)** were explored, with a focus on interpreting network traffic to detect potential threats.
- **Security Information Event Management (SIEM) tools**, like Splunk and Chronicle, were used to search through logs, monitor activity, and investigate security alerts.
- Packet sniffing and analysis tools, like **tcpdump** and **Wireshark**, were utilized to capture network traffic and analyze packets for signs of malicious activity.

#### Artifact Investigation
I learned how to examine and investigate digital artifacts, like logs and file hashes, to verify the authenticity of potential security incidents. This hands-on experience helped me build skills for analyzing security events and identifying indicators of compromise (IoCs).

#### Querying SIEM Tools
I developed the ability to perform queries within SIEM tools to investigate events, monitor system activity, and analyze logs for suspicious behavior.
