# Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities - Course Overview

This course provided a comprehensive introduction to key concepts in cybersecurity, focusing on how organizations protect their digital assets and mitigate risks. Below is a summary of the topics and skills covered throughout the course:
What I Learned
1. Asset Classification and Data Protection

    Explored the importance of asset classification and how it helps security teams prioritize their efforts.
    Learned about digital assets in the three states of data: at rest, in transit, and in use, and how policies, standards, and procedures help mitigate organizational risk.

2. NIST Cybersecurity Framework

    Introduced to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a widely used framework for managing risk.
    Explored various security systems and controls, focusing on technologies like encryption, public key infrastructure (PKI), and digital certificates to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

3. Access Controls: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)

    Delved into access control mechanisms that are part of the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) framework, which help secure sensitive systems and data.

4. Defense in Depth Strategy

    Explored the defense in depth strategy, which layers security measures to protect information as it is exchanged online.
    Studied the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list and learned about the vulnerability assessment process to identify and mitigate risks.

5. Attack Vectors and Threat Modeling

    Identified various attack surfaces and vectors that threat actors use to exploit systems, such as social engineering, malware, and web-based exploits.
    Learned how to conduct threat modeling to predict and prevent potential attacks by understanding vulnerabilities and attack methods.

6. Major Threats and How to Counter Them

    Explored major threats to asset security, including social engineering, malware, and web-based exploits, and how security teams work to prevent these attacks.

This course has laid the foundation for a deeper understanding of cybersecurity, with real-world applications that can help assess and protect against risks. It emphasized how essential it is to stay proactive in the field and apply the knowledge learned to secure systems and assets.
